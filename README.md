# Final-Project.-Happy-Data-
Final Project Data Science course at allWomen 

This is my Final Project for my Data Science course at allWomen.
For this project I wanted to apply all the different concepts that we learned in the course. 

My project has three parts, in the first part I analyze the datasets from the World Happiness Report from 2017 to 2020 to see the evolution of the happiness index in Europe and especially in Spain. This first part of the project is in the notebooks part 1 and 2. 

The main features obtained from the WHR datasets are: Happines_score|GDP|Social_support|Life_exp_score|Freedom|Generosity|Gov_trust|Life_exp_age . In my second part of the project I check the correlation between the different variables from the dataset and the Life Expectancy in the different countries. And I use four different Machine Learning models to predict the Life Expectancy. The models used for this predictions are: Multi Linear regression, Decision Tree regression, Random Forest regression and XGBOOST. This second part of the project is in the notebooks from part 3 to part 8. 

And the third part of the project is an analysis of the different Apps for mental health and happiness in the Google Play store. I did two different web scrapings searching for apps related to mental health, happiness, personal growth, motivation and self esteem. I study the number of apps per category, the rates and number of downloads for the three main categories (Health and Wellness, Lifestyle and Entertainment) and finally I get the reviews for these apps. With the reviews I do a NLP to see the most commons words used in the reviews and the average length of them and I apply VADER to do a sentiment analysis of them. I check the number of positive, neutral and negative reviews as well as the most common words in them and I plot them in two wordclouds. As the reviews were extracted from the spanish google play web most of them were in spanish, so in order to use VADER, which works in English, I had to use the Google Translate API, googletrans , to translate them in python. 
This third part can be found from notebook part 9 to part 16

There is a folder with all the different datasets used and a .zip with some plots.
